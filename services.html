                                            <p> Missile characteristics
Propulsion: Missiles can use either solid or liquid propellant rocket motors, or air-breathing jet engines.
Guidance: They almost always contain a guidance and control mechanism to ensure accuracy.
Warheads: Missiles can carry conventional explosives, or, in the case of strategic missiles, nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.
Payload: The warhead is the missile's payload, which is delivered to a specific location to destroy a target. 
Types of missiles
Ballistic missiles: These are rocket-propelled and follow a high, arcing trajectory after an initial boost phase. They are classified by range: short-range (1,000 km), medium-range (1,000–3,000 km), intermediate-range (3,000–5,500 km), and intercontinental (more than 5,500 km).
Cruise missiles: These are powered by jet engines and fly at low, level altitudes for sustained periods. They are often considered more accurate than ballistic missiles due to their low flight path.
Tactical missiles: These are short-range systems designed for limited strikes in a smaller area.
Strategic missiles: These are long-range weapons designed for targets beyond the immediate vicinity, and are often used to carry nuclear warheads. </p>

                        <h3>Mumbai taj attack</h3>
                        <p>Date and Duration: The attacks began on November 26, 2008, and continued for four days, ending on November 29.
Location: Multiple high-profile locations across South Mumbai were targeted, including the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (main railway station), the Oberoi Trident hotel, the Leopold Cafe, and the Nariman House (a Jewish cultural center).
Perpetrators: Ten heavily armed gunmen from Lashkar-e-Taiba arrived in Mumbai by sea from Karachi, Pakistan. Nine of the attackers were killed by security forces, and the sole survivor, Ajmal Kasab, was captured, tried, and executed in 2012.
Casualties: A total of 175 people died (including nine attackers and many foreigners) and more than 300 were injured across all sites. Approximately 31 people were killed in the siege at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. 
The Siege at the Taj Hotel
Four of the ten terrorists entered the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, where they engaged in mass shootings and took hostages. The siege at the hotel lasted the longest of all the attack sites, with Indian National Security Guard (NSG) commandos engaging in a fierce battle to flush out the remaining terrorists. 
Key events at the Taj included:
Initial gunfire and explosions in the lobby and restaurants on the evening of November 26.
A massive fire that engulfed the hotel's central dome and upper floors on November 27.
The rescue of hundreds of guests and staff members, some via ladders from windows.
Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, an NSG commando, was fatally shot while leading operations to rescue hostages at the hotel and was posthumously awarded India's highest peacetime gallantry award, the Ashoka Chakra.
The operation finally concluded on the morning of November 29, when the last remaining terrorists were killed. .</p>

                                <div class="author-name"> Subhas Chandra Bose</div>
                                <div class="author-position">Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent Indian nationalist leader who played a key role in the fight for India's independence from British rule. After passing the Indian Civil Services exam but resigning to join the freedom struggle, he became a prominent member of the Indian National Congress. He was known for his more radical approach to achieving independence, eventually forming the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) to fight against the British, and is widely remembered as "Netaji". His life is a story of dedication to his cause, marked by a nationalist upbringing, leadership in the Congress, controversial international alliances, and an enduring legacy shrouded in mystery surrounding his death.  
Early life and political awakening
Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, to a prominent lawyer, Janakinath Bose. 
Showed academic brilliance from a young age and was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda's teachings, which he considered a spiritual guru. 
In 1919, he went to England to prepare for the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination and was selected. 
However, upon learning of the nationalist unrest in India, he resigned in 1921 and returned to join the freedom movement, according to Aakash and Vedantu. 
Leadership and the Indian National Congress
Initially worked with the Indian National Congress and became the president in 1938 and re-elected in 1939.
His political differences with Mahatma Gandhi regarding the use of force for independence led him to resign from the presidency.
He then formed the All India Forward Bloc, a faction within the Congress party, to consolidate the political left. 
Revolutionary activities and the Indian National Army (INA)
Bose believed in taking bold, revolutionary steps to achieve freedom, unlike some leaders who chose peaceful methods. 
He traveled to Germany and later Southeast Asia, where he sought support from Axis powers during World War II. 
He revived the Indian National Army (INA) to fight against the British, mobilizing Indian prisoners of war and civilians. 
His famous slogan was, "{Give me blood and I shall give you freedom}". 
Disappearance and legacy
After Japan's surrender in 1945, Bose reportedly died in a plane crash in Taiwan from burn injuries. 
His ashes are believed to have been preserved at a Buddhist temple in Tokyo, but this has been a subject of mystery and debate, with some people believing he survived. 
Bose's story is one of a fearless leader who, despite facing many struggles, left a lasting impact on India's freedom movement. His legacy continues to be remembered for his courage and patriotism. </div>

                                <div class="author-position">Bhagat Singh is famous for being a revolutionary freedom fighter who played a pivotal role in the Indian independence movement against British rule. He is revered as a martyr and national hero for his courage and sacrifice, known for acts of resistance like the 1929 bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly and for popularizing the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad".  
Revolutionary activism: Singh was a key leader in the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and participated in several acts of sabotage against British institutions. 
Legendary acts of defiance: In a well-known 1929 protest, he and a colleague threw bombs into the Central Legislative Assembly to protest the Defence of India Act and then surrendered. 
Lahore Conspiracy Case: He was convicted of murdering a British police officer, John Saunders, who was mistakenly killed while the revolutionaries had intended to assassinate a different official. 
Symbol of courage: Singh became a national icon for his unwavering commitment to independence and social justice, inspiring many with his actions and ideals. 
"Shaheed" (Martyr): His execution at the age of 23 in 1931 cemented his legacy as one of India's most revered heroes, leading to him being known as "Shaheed Bhagat Singh". </div>
