## WebGL Features

### Particle System
The custom WebGL particle system creates an immersive background effect:
- 3D particle positioning with depth perception
- Dynamic connections between nearby particles
- Interaction with mouse movements and clicks
- Special burst effects on user interactions

### Fluid Simulation
The physics-based fluid simulation creates flowing, organic visuals:
- Navier-Stokes equations for realistic fluid dynamics
- Velocity, pressure, and density calculations
- Vorticity confinement for natural swirls
- Interactive splats that respond to user actions
- Bloom shading effects for enhanced visual appeal

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android)

## Performance Considerations

The WebGL effects are optimized for performance:
- Automatic downsampling on lower-end devices
- Reduced particle count on mobile devices
- Limited connections between particles
- Optimized shader compilation
